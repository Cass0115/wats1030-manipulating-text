After doing the exercises in the three different text editors I came to conclusion that 
I like Nano the best for me. I thought it was the easiest to use from the get go, and I
like options at the bottom. I also think that the commands were easier to use, and not
as confusing as vi. Emacs was a good option too. It was easy to use, but I thought it 
was a bit clunkier to use. Vi was my least favorite. I got frustrated by the commands
and moving around was also harder. Then when I would get where I needed to be I would
forget to change to instert mode. Watching some of the videos, it looked like vi could
be really great to use, but I think I'd have to spend some more time to get comfortable.
